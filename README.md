## todotxt
A simple version for todo.txt, written in pure Rust

I would love to have a really simple program for managing my tasks and hopefully it will comes in handy for you too!


## Installation
The pre-built binary in the Release page is for Linux.

1. Visit the Release page to download the binary
2. Make it executable `chmod +x todotxt`
3. Move the binary file to any folders you want, preferably `~/.local/bin` for quick access from the terminal.
